# School-Management-System
This is a beginner-friendly, console-based School Management System written in core Java, demonstrating essential Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.it walks through creating a practical academic management tool without using databases or external frameworks
# Key Features & Concepts
 # Student and Course Management
 The system allows users to add and store multiple Student and Course objects. Each student has attributes like ID, name, age, and a list of enrolled courses. Course objects encapsulate course ID, name, and   instructor.

 # Enrollment Handling
 You can enroll a student in multiple courses, and implement logic to view a student’s enrolled courses or list all students in a given course. This simulates a minimal scheduling/database system through in-memory collections such as ArrayList.

 # Core OOP Principles
 The project strongly emphasizes:

 Encapsulation: Using private fields with public getters/setters.

 Abstraction: Separating user-interaction logic from data classes.

 Inheritance/Composition: While not deeply hierarchical, it illustrates composition by associating students with courses.

 Modularity: Classes like Student, Course, and SchoolManagementSystem are clearly separated for ease of maintenance.

 # User Interaction & Control Flow
 A console-based menu offers options like "Add Student", "Register Course", "Enroll Student", "Display Reports", etc. User choices are read via a Scanner, and relevant methods are invoked based on selections—teaching beginners structured interaction and control flow in Java.

Educational Value
The tutorial stresses writing readable, maintainable Java code. It introduces beginners to project structure in a real OOP scenario, helping confidently transition from "write some classes" to building a functional, multi-class application
